                <h3><b>Something the Lord Made.</b></h3>
              <p>This is a documentary that has been my Family's Valentine's Day tradition (known by us as CHD Day). It is about two doctor's Vivian Thomas and Alfred Blalock who partnered together during a time when they when it was socialy unacepetable because of the fact Vivian was black. The reason why it is so important to me is because they created the surgery that save mine and millions of others like me lives.</p>
                
            <p>This surgery was made to help "Blue Babies" which are what they sound like babies who are born blue because of some complex heart defect. One of the interesting parts of the creation of this surgery was that a decent part of the tools and reaserch was done by Vivean Thomas a black carpenter with 0 medical experience other than from reading books.</p>

                <h3><b>Temple Grandin</b></h3>
                <p>Yet another medical based documentry on my list... this time about autism. My older brother is on the spectrum but we did not know that until he was around 10 years old (not really sure though). After we watched this movie my parents sat us down and explained what autism is and that my older brother had it. So this movie means a lot about me because I was able to relate my previous experiences I had with my brother with something.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this movie as the title suggest is about the now "motivational speaker and writer" (I guess that's what you call her now) journal through adulting living with Autism. My family really had something about only on TV HBO Documentries I guess (as you do)...</p>

                <h3><b>Spider-Man 1, 2 and 3</b></h3>
                <p>On a lighter note (not really... these movies were pretty dark) I wanted to add Spider-Man 1, 2 and 3 because these were a big part of my childhood (much to my Moms disaproval). Spider-Man 1 was my first super hero movie which I watched on our old portable DVD player with my brothers. We quickly watched the second one also because I think at that time the third one was going to come out. In a rebelious move by all my brothers we got our Aunt and Uncle to blockbuster (gosh i'm old) the third one and watch it with us even though we were specificly told not to. I had nightmares but, boy was it worth it.</p>

                <h3><b>Ratatouille</b></h3>
                <p>This was a <i><b>REALLY</b></i> wierd movie... but it was the first movie I went to the theatures for so you have to give it credit. It's one of those movies that I have not really had the chance to rewatch but I probably should. It really started the tradition of me/brothers and my Grandparents on my Dad's side going to the movies every so often.</p>
                <p>There isn't really much to say other than the movie hurts me because of having to deal with health inspecters working at my parent's coffee shop back in the day... 😭😭😭</p>

                <p>👏The 👏 Veggie 👏 Tales 👏 Movie 👏 was 👏 the 👏 💣. 👏</p>
                <p>Sorry about that... anyway... The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything was my favorite childhood movie because Veggie Tales was a big part of my childhood. A big part of my pre homeschool days was checking out these movies at the library. Then we would watch them on our VHS tv in our room once a week. When the movie came out we watched it during a one day theature event with my Grandparents (I talked about them in the Ratatoullie section).</p>
